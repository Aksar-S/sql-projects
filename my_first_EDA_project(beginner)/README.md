This project showcases how I performed **data cleaning** and **exploratory analysis** using **MySQL Workbench** on a raw e-commerce sales dataset.

## 📊 Key Cleaning Steps

- Removed duplicates

- Standardized casing (e.g. category lowercase, region uppercase)
- Converted dates and numeric fields
- Removed invalid rows (e.g. rows with missing essential data or quantity = 0)
- Added calculated column `total_sale`
